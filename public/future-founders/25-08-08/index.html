        <h2>Free App Idea of the Week | Screenshit</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">
          An app that can take all of the screenshots from a Mac desktop, and
          uses OCR and AI to categorise and tag all screenshots for future use,
          whilst also clearing up the desktop.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="component newsletter-content">
        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Mac desktops are the default location for screenshots, which can
          quickly lead to a cluttered and disorganised mess ... which is
          annoying. As users take more and more screenshots, the desktop becomes
          a dumping ground of miscellaneous images with generic file names like
          "Screenshot 2023-10-27 at 10.30.00 AM." Finding a specific screenshot
          later becomes a frustrating and time-consuming task, forcing users to
          either manually sort through a disorganised pile of nonsense or give
          up on retrieving the information altogether, or funnily leads to
          taking another screenshot.
        </p>

        <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
        <p>
          By creating an app that automatically processes, tags, and archives
          screenshots, we can eliminate desktop clutter and make it effortless
          for users to find any screenshot they've ever taken, saving time and
          reducing frustration.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Potential Features</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Automated Organisation and Tagging:</strong> The app would
          constantly monitor the desktop for new screenshots. Using Optical
          Character Recognition (OCR), it would read the text within the image
          and then use AI to understand the context.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Smart Search:</strong> With all screenshots properly tagged
          and indexed, the app would provide a powerful search function. A user
          could simply type "pasta recipe" or "financial report" and the app
          would instantly pull up all relevant screenshots.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Desktop Cleanup and Archiving:</strong> The app's primary
          function would be to clear the desktop. As soon as a screenshot is
          taken and processed, it would be automatically moved from the desktop
          to a designated, organised folder within the app's archive. This keeps
          the desktop clean and clutter-free (mmmm nice) while still making the
          screenshots easily accessible and searchable from within the app
          itself.
        </p>

        <h3>Mockup of Screenshit</h3>
        <p>
          Here is an example of what the app could look like (viewable on
          desktop only). The app would have a clean, minimalist design, focusing
          on functionality and ease of use. The main screen would display a grid
          of screenshots, each with a small preview and the associated tags. A
          search bar at the top would allow users to find specific screenshots
          quickly. The left sidebar would provide access to different categories
          or tags, making it easy to browse through archived screenshots.
        </p>

        <p>
          Week 15 of pivoting my business to a coaching service, and things are
          going well. Videos to shoot and edit, new faces to meet, each
          interaction enjoyable but also a little draining. The days were filled
          with a massive outreach effort, all focused on getting more people
          interested in what I'm building.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          With the algo being what it is, I am going to lean on email more over
          the coming weeks. I've even been considering starting a micro-vlog,
          documenting the entire process of building a micro-SaaS to give people
          a real look behind the curtain. And in between all of this, I'm making
          sure to dedicate time to more sessions with my clients, the people who
          remind me why this work is so important.

          GPT-5 has been released. It’s better, but not game-changing; however,

          After implementing platform and tool enhancements that reduced the
          need for customer support, Atlassian cut 150 jobs in its customer
          service and support departments. The job cuts were announced in a
          prerecorded message from CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes, which was released
          just hours before co-founder Scott Farquhar gave a speech to the
          Australian Press Club. In his address, Farquhar called on Australia to
          embrace an “AI revolution” and move past the “jobs of the past.”
          Atlassian, an Australian software firm, was founded in 2002.

          Scale AI is letting go of about 200 employees, which is roughly 14% of
          its workforce, and cutting ties with 500 contractors. This decision
          comes shortly after Meta made a $14.3 billion deal with the
          data-labelling startup, bringing in Scale AI's CEO to lead a new lab.
          The layoffs are part of a broader restructuring, with the company's
          interim CEO citing "inefficiencies and redundancies" that were created
          by a rapid expansion in its generative AI division.

          AI is doing job interviews now, but candidates say they'd rather risk
          staying unemployed than talk to another robot. Can’t blame them.

        <h2>How they got to Success (and how you can copy their homework)</h2>
        <p>
          Tinder's initial go-to-market strategy was a masterclass in grassroots
          adoption, focusing on a deep understanding of its target audience's
          existing habits. Instead of relying on traditional advertising, the
          company directly engaged with college students by hosting parties and
          going to campus clubs.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The core of this strategy was a simple yet effective tactic: they
          would give out free merchandise, including t-shirts, to female
          students with a message that directly addressed a common social
          interaction.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          These shirts, which read "don't ask for my number, find me on Tinder,"
          cleverly preempted the old method of exchanging contact information
          and simultaneously advertised the app as the new, cooler alternative.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This hands-on approach built a critical mass of early adopters by
          meeting people where the "old" problem (meeting new people and
          exchanging numbers) was already being solved, creating a network
          effect that quickly drove widespread behavioural change and
          established Tinder as the dominant force in mobile dating.
