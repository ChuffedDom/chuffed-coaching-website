              helped me visualize a realistic path forward. His guidance on
              dividing the project into smaller, achievable deliverables was
              brilliant, and he pushed my thinking on product requirements in
              all the right ways. A truly productive and insightful session!

              As a Full-time Developer turned Technical Founder, it's easy for
              me to hack away for hours on features no one has asked for. I
              needed someone that could show me how to redefine my passion
              project into a marketable product. Dom understands the dev mindset
              and knows how to break it out of "solution tunnel vision". Our
              conversations often tread into unexpected territory, but I always
              come away with new excitement to work on my business.

              <p>
                With a history of being a Head of Product, I built a company,
                Chuffed Solutions, that has launched digital products for my
                clients since 2021.
              </p>
              <p>I also own apps that I have monetised.</p>
              <p>
                That leads to me sitting with developers like yourself and
                talking about what they are working on in their spare time.
              </p>
              <p>
                But they get stuck levelling up the code when, in actual fact,
                the most effective advice I give them are the easy wins for the
                product management and go-to-market.
              </p>
              <p>
                Therefore, I want to help you get your product out there and get
                you to a place where financial indepence is in your hands, not
                at the whims of Shareholders.
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                But the bigger picture is this; I want the next generation of
                tech owners to be the people who genuinely innovate.
