            “Before Dom joined, we lacked a guiding force for our product-market
            fit and struggled to bridge the gap between our product and
            marketing departments. Dom stepped in seamlessly, showcasing
            autonomy, ingenuity, and exceptional skill. I am confident that Dom
            will continue to lead our product-marketing role with the same level
            of excellence displayed during their time with us.” — Jake Edwards.

            </div>
            <div class="grid-items">
              <p>
                With a history of being a Head of Product, I built a company,
                Chuffed Solutions, that has launched digital products for my
                clients since 2021.
              </p>
              <p>I also own apps that I have monetised.</p>
              <p>
                That leads to me sitting with developers like yourself and
                talking about what they are working on in their spare time.
              </p>
              <p>
                But they get stuck levelling up the code when, in actual fact,
                the most effective advice I give them are the easy wins for the
                product management and go-to-market.
              </p>
              <p>
                Therefore, I want to help you get your product out there and get
                you to a place where financial indepence is in your hands, not
                at the whims of Shareholders.
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                But the bigger picture is this; I want the next generation of
                tech owners to be the people who genuinely innovate.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let's build great products for great people by great creators.
